# Consumer_Complaints
Consumer complaint resolution is important to any business. In this particular case we have been given detailed consumer complaints along with whether consumer disputed with the conclusion. If we are able to predict this, consumer who is more likely to dispute a conclusion can be given more attention as to how the complaints are handled as well as how persuasively the final conclusions are conveyed to them.
## Target Variable
Your target here is to build prediction model for column "Consumer disputed".

## Problem Statement
Your target here is to build prediction model so that you are able to predict which consumer is more likely to
dispute the resolution of a complaint i.e. you need to make predictions for the "Consumer disputed" column.
All the column names are self explanatory. You need to build your model on train data. Test data does not have
the response column "Consumer disputed", you need to predict those values and submit it in a csv format.

## Evaluation Criteria
In order to get a passing grade in this project you need to have the AUC score of at least 0.54 for your test data
predictions.
